ToDo short term:
Add active int for Preset and correct while in PrimePitchesPreset to stop. Test if p15 needs to run/1::samp/nothing.
PitchHandler stays longer on harmonics
gainGesture fade PitchHandler style, and see above
Real transition beatplayer/stepgeneralout. Need fade out even when no stepgeneralout. See why _launch TypicalPresetTrack ends abruptly.
Remove (now - xenakeur.startRec) from getParams and computeWaitSamp
add control fadeRelease SamplePlayer with yield()
Keep nb of active GOs in preset to know when to done (fadeTrack())
N exponential variables triggering N events, begin by first one played (min) and then redraw, then 2nd etc. Min(N exps) is exp too. Think about sum as well.
Better system for out management TypicalPresetTrack
Make nbIsAlive by section in GazParams
Initialize particules uniformly depending on volume of section in GazParams
